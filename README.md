Project for Deep Learning Class

Introduction -

A deep understanding of lane boundary position is vital for vehicle safety, which is needed to avoid collisions and localize vehicle. Lanes boundaries detection accuracy has increased significantly since introduction of deep learning, with majority of recent systems using convolutional neural networks to process sensorial data and infer high-level information.  The use of LiDAR is extremely expensive therefore as an alternative, comparatively cheaper cameras are used which can utilize chromatic differences on the road.
